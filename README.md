## 💬 Honest Talk

Created Entree because getting tired of:
- Searching for files manually across massive directory trees
- Wondering "what changed?" between system snapshots
- Paying for cloud-based audit tools that expose our data
- Clunky automation that breaks with every update

**Entree is different.** Fast, local, and yours.
